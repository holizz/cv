  <h1>Objective</h1>
  <p>To be my best. <!-- Yes this is a Dollhouse reference --> That means I want to make software that works, master the tools I use, and make superior and complimentary tools to help me and my colleages to do better work.

  <p>My current position is at The Dextrous Web. I have grown very fond of the company and am reluctant to give up such an excellent position that has constantly challenged me in many ways. However I am moving to Atlanta, GA for personal reasons and so must give up a job which I firmly believe to have been one of the best available to me as a recent graduate, and one which would have certainly expanded in scope and complexity in sync with my skills.

  <p>In pursuit of furthering my career I am looking for full-time employment in Atlanta, GA. Ideally, it would be a position with opportunity for progression in a small-to-medium Web development company.
