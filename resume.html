  <h1>Objective</h1>
  <p>To be my best. <!-- Yes this is a Dollhouse reference --> That means I want to make software that works, master the tools I use, and make superior and complimentary tools to help me and my colleages/peers to do better work.

  <p>My current position is at The Dextrous Web. I have grown very fond of the company and am reluctant to give up such an excellent position that has constantly challenged me in many ways. However I am moving to Atlanta, GA for personal reasons and so must give up a job which I firmly believe to have been one of the best available to me as a recent graduate, and one which would have certainly grown in scope and complexity as my skills matured.

  <p>In pursuit of furthering my career I am looking for full-time employment in Atlanta, GA. Ideally, it would be a position with some opportunity for progression in a Web development company.

  <h1>Experience</h1>
  <ol>

    <li>
      <h2>Developer at The Dextrous Web 2009-present</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>From my first moment at the company I have been working on a varied array of projects, including the government's first Rails application, many small WordPress sites, Capistrano recipes, a Web spider, and processing and analysing multi-million line government data sets.
        <li>Initiated many side projects (some as 20% projects - a la Google): set up a gitosis server with gitweb interface, wrote a Capistrano recipe for WordPress, made a WordPress plugin for attaching posts to posts (which we now use in the majority of our WordPress sites), submitted patches for WordPress core, made a PHP SASS processor for use during development.
        <li>Worked on many projects independently, most with my boss, and some with freelancers too.
        <li>Found my niche as the resident git and vim expert at the company (I was also adept at obscure HTML facts, and general Linux shell commands). I was surprised to find that I quickly developed a skill for backporting CSS to Internet Explorer (or writing compatible code in the first place).
      </ul>
